App purpose - create a place where couples and families can create "A-Z Challenges". These challenges allow people to take turns choosing a different activity starting with each letter of the alphabet, and updating when they completed the activity.

MVP Version 1:
1a. Create new user account (email, password, name)
1b. Validate email
2a. Create new Challenge Group (name, auto generates first activity record)
2b. Change Challenge Group name
2c. Manage Challege Member names
3a. Select Activity Owner
3b. Input Activity Details
3c. Mark Activity as Complete (date, auto generates next activity record)

To follow:
- Invite Challenge Members to join group via email (can edit Activity record)
- Invite friends to view Challenge via email (can view Activity records)
- Comment on activities (own challege and friend's challenges)

14/06/2016:
- 1a (without email), 2a, 2c done.
- Decided to defer email-based registration as not out of the box Django, and focus on Challenge and Activity management first.
